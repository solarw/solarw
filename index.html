			Asyncio
MongoDB (nice storage), QT (best crossplatform GUI toolkit ever),
SSH(protocol you always use) 

I have a pet project: RPC framework for microservice architecture, like gRPC,
but without type definitions, peer-to-peer concept, secure, python3 oriented.
Developed on top of asyncio and ssh protocol specifications.
Got a working prototype with pyqt ui support, networking, simple storage
and even full js support to write services right in js.

				<b>What about Python?</b><br>
				Strong experiense with famous python frameworks: Django, Tornado, Flask
Asyncio, threads, multiprocessing as special interest.
Some desktop experience: PyQT
Python extending with ctypes and extensions in swig or cython
 
				<br><br>
			
				<b>What about Web?</b><br>
				Most of the projects I worked on are backend projects.
I have strong knowledges how WWW and network work (browsers, servers, protocols, and so on)
Familiar with JS, but I'm a python developer, so backend is my passion!
 
				<br><br>
			
				<b>What about Linux?</b><br>
				I'm everyday Linux user for more than 12 years, so I really know what Linux is.
Strong experience in configuring servers for various usages, scripting, automation.
Linux is like my second home)   
 
				<br><br>
			
				<b>SQL experience?</b><br>
				Worked mostly with Postgres with django orm, sqlalchemy.
 Have worked with complicated joins, nested queries, partitioning. 
 
				<br><br>
			
				<b>NOSQL skills?</b><br>
				MongoDB, really love it. Worked a lot with Redis. 
				<br><br>
			
				<b>Languages I speak</b><br>
				Russian, English (IELTS overal score: 6) 
				<br><br>
			
				<b>Remote? Relocation?</b><br>
				Will check any variant in details! UK/EU/US work permit assistance is required! 
				<br><br>
			
				<b>Mentorship?</b><br>
				I was asked to run personal classes for C++ developer about python.
Main topics were: python and limitation for CPU bound tasks, parallel programming,
MPI, python speedup with c/c++ modules. Classes were 3-4 hours long for 5 days in a row.
At the end of the course there was a practical project with the appliance of all technologies studied:
build a simple CPU bound python app, then distributed it with MPI and speedup with swig/ctypes/cython.
Developer studied everything and confirmed knowledge with a finished test task.
 
				<br><br>
			
				<b>Any management experience?</b><br>
				I worked as a project manager on Digital Signage project.
I created a team of 3 developers I managed.
I communicated the customer directly.
The project was frozen after 2 months of development, cause investment issues.
The first presentation of the prototype (mobile app, admin console) was successful
and was approved by customer and investor,
but investor decided to stop funding the project by own reason and customer did not find another funding source.
The project was started well and I regret it was not completed.
